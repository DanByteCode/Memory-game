# League of Memory
Minigame inspired on the League of Legends introduction screens.
- The rules are simple, you must select all the characters shown without repeating, each time you get it right they will change position randomly.
- By selecting all the cards you will level up, each time the number of characters will increase.
- Points will be accumulated for each success, but failing will reset the level score.
*Good luck*
